# weatherific-fork

This is a fork of Doug Luce's Weatherific app, which you can see [here](https://github.com/Doug-Luce/Weatherific).

I refactored the AJAX requests utilizing the Axios library, and changed geolocation-based weather into a form that gets weather data based on on the inputted city and displays it on the screen. I also redid the CSS.
